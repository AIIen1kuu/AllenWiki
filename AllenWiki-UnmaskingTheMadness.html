        <h2>The Problem</h2>
        <p>
            In today's society, the government locks away individuals deemed "crazy" because they seek to expose the deep-rooted corruption and injustice within the political system. These so-called crazy people are not insane, they are dissidents who are silenced, imprisoned, and often executed for revealing truths that those in power want to keep hidden. Rather than addressing their claims, they are labeled as mentally unstable and institutionalized.

        <h2>Alarming Statistics</h2>
        <p>
            Over 3.4 million individuals have been admitted to mental institutions in the United States over the last decade, many of whom were targeted for their outspoken opposition to systemic corruption.

        <h2>What You Can Do</h2>
        <p>
            It's time to change the narrative. Question what you've been told about mental health, dissent, and the role of government in suppressing opposition. Stand with those who have been wrongfully institutionalized and demand transparency, fairness, and justice.
